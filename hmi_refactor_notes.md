### Report on Addressing Issues with `get_HMI_screens.py` Script

#### Current Problem
The `get_HMI_screens.py` script is not exporting any screens, and the terminal output indicates that no HMI software is found for the devices. This issue is likely due to the mismatch between the TIA Openness API version (v15) used in the wrapper and the TIA Portal version (v17) installed on the system.

#### Analysis of Relevant Files
1. **`get_HMI_screens.py`**:
   - This script attempts to open a TIA Portal project, retrieve devices, and export HMI screens.
   - The script uses the `HmiSoftware` class to interact with HMI devices and export screens.

2. **`tia_portal/__init__.py`**:
   - This file contains the main classes and functions for interacting with the TIA Portal Openness API.
   - It imports various Siemens Engineering components and defines classes like `Device`, `HmiSoftware`, and `ExportOptions`.

3. **`typings/Siemens/Engineering/Hmi/__init__.pyi`**:
   - This file provides type definitions and annotations for HMI-related components in the Siemens Engineering API.
   - It defines the `HmiTarget` class and its properties and methods.

#### Key Issues Identified
1. **Version Mismatch**:
   - The wrapper is based on TIA Openness API v15, but the installed version is v17. This can cause compatibility issues, as the API structure and available methods might have changed.

2. **Device and Software Retrieval**:
   - The script fails to retrieve the software container for the devices, resulting in no HMI software being found.

3. **Type Definitions**:
   - The type definitions in `typings/Siemens/Engineering/Hmi/__init__.pyi` might be outdated or incomplete for v17.

#### Proposed Steps to Address the Issues

1. **Update Imports and Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the DLL path and imports in `tia_portal/__init__.py` are updated to reflect the new version (v17) of the Siemens Engineering DLL.
   - Handle any new exceptions or changes in the API structure introduced in v17.

2. **Update Class Definitions**:
   - **Device Class**:
     - Add new properties and methods introduced in v17, such as `HwUtilities`, `HistoryEntries`, `Languages`, and `LanguageSettings`.
     - Ensure existing methods are compatible with the new API structure.
   - **HmiSoftware Class**:
     - Update the `HmiSoftware` class to handle any changes in the HMI software structure in v17.
     - Ensure that methods like `export_screen` are compatible with the new API.

3. **Update Type Definitions**:
   - **`typings/Siemens/Engineering/Hmi/__init__.pyi`**:
     - Add new properties and methods for HMI components introduced in v17.
     - Ensure existing type definitions are compatible with the new API structure.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Write unit tests to validate the new functionality and ensure backward compatibility.
   - Perform integration tests with TIA Portal v17 to ensure the wrapper functions correctly with the new API.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update the README and other documentation to reflect changes and new features introduced in v17.
   - Provide a migration guide for users upgrading from v15 to v17.

#### Detailed Plan for `get_HMI_screens.py`

1. **Update Device Retrieval**:
   - Ensure that the `get_software` method in the `Device` class correctly retrieves the software container for devices in v17.

2. **Update HMI Software Handling**:
   - Ensure that the `HmiSoftware` class correctly interacts with HMI software components in v17.
   - Update the `export_screen` method to handle any changes in the export process.

3. **Debugging and Logging**:
   - Add detailed logging to help identify where the script fails to retrieve HMI software or export screens.
